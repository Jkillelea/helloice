HelloIce is a set of small Verilog programs to check your Lattice IceStick FPGA 
hardware and toolchain are configured correctly.

This project exists to support [this blog post on installing open-source tools for Lattice IceStick FPGA](https://appcodelabs.com/?p=693&preview=true)

Install the tools as instructed in the post before attempting to run these examples.

Contains the following sample programs:-

1. green.v: turn on the green LED
2. blink.v: blink the red LED
3. counter.v: count a binary sequence on the red LEDs.
